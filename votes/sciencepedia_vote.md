# A Vote for New Projects:  sciencepedia

## Proposal

The output of scientific knowledge far exceeds humanity’s ability to absorb and verify it, leading to irreproducibility, knowledge redundancy, and difficulty in distinguishing truth from falsehood. Therefore, __SciencePedia__ is proposed — an open-source, human-AI collaborative scientific knowledge base that takes "knowledge points" as its basic units and features a structured, verifiable, and dynamically evolving design.

SciencePedia rapidly generates interdisciplinary knowledge points and question-answer pairs through Long-Chain of Thought (LCoT), establishes a preliminary interdependency network and community mechanism, and on this basis, gradually expands data sources and application scenarios to drive the continuous update and evolution of the scientific knowledge base. To date, it has generated 4 million question-answer pairs across 200 disciplines, formed 40,000 coarse-grained knowledge pages and 200,000 fine-grained knowledge pages, and initially established cross-referencing relationships and a community mechanism.

SciencePedia will provide an efficient tool for evidence integration and cutting-edge exploration in scientific research, serve as a foundation for generating personalized teaching materials in education, and transform future scientific research paradigms through a platform-based Agent-Ready knowledge system.
